# Mi5 Startup NW-App

This app helps to start several programs of our Showcase. It is based on [nw.js](http://nwjs.io/), which is also on [github](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js). 

## Getting Started

* First, download and install [nw.js](http://nwjs.io/downloads/). If necessary, add nw to your `$PATH`.

* In the folder of this README file, run
 ```npm install```

* Edit and rename the files within the `./config` folder. You need to delete the word 'sample' in each name.

* Now you are ready to run this app with ```nw .``` at the place of the `package.json` file.
